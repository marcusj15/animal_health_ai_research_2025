Marcus Milons is a freshman at Raymond High School from the rural town of Bolton, Mississippi. Growing up on a farm, Marcus developed a strong connection with animals and an appreciation for the quiet lessons of nature. Surrounded by the daily rhythms of farm life, he became curious about how technology could make life better, not just for people, but for animals too.

With a natural talent for problem-solving and a deep interest in computers, Marcus has set his sights on a future in the tech world. He plans to attend Hinds Community College after high school, using it as a stepping stone toward a four-year university. His top choices include Mississippi State University, Georgia Tech, and IT University, where he hopes to pursue a degree in computer science or information technology.

Inspired by his environment and driven by a desire to help others through innovation, Marcus is eager to learn, build, and use technology to solve real-world problems. Whether itâ€™s coding, designing systems, or just figuring out how things work, Marcus is always looking for the next opportunity to grow and make a meaningful impact.
