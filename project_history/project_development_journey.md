# üõ†Ô∏è Project Development Journey

Once the idea for PetScope was approved by my team, I began by outlining the project's core features and creating an initial Trello board to help organize my thoughts. I worked on naming the project, identifying what problem it would solve, and brainstorming the basic functionality that would make it useful for real-world animal caretakers like myself.

Throughout development, I encountered several challenges. One major struggle was adapting to feedback from my team, which often led to revising, rewriting, or completely removing sections of the project to make room for better ideas. These changes were necessary for improvement, but they required flexibility, patience, and a willingness to let go of earlier drafts.

I leaned heavily on YouTube tutorials and research to learn the technologies and concepts I needed, especially in areas like artificial intelligence and computer vision, which were new to me. Tools like Trello, Google Docs, and Microsoft Word helped me keep track of my progress, organize my content, and rewrite sections as needed.

One of the biggest shifts during development was refining the foundation of PetScope so that its parts worked together logically and smoothly. What began as a basic idea had to be restructured multiple times to ensure flow and clarity between components.

In the end, I‚Äôm most proud of the concept itself and everything I learned along the way. While the development process had its ups and downs, I‚Äôm excited to be in the final stages, preparing for presentation and sharing what I‚Äôve built.
