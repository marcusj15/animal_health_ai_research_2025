My name is Marcus Milons. I’m a 10th-grade student attending Raymond High School in Raymond, Mississippi, with a strong interest in technology, problem-solving, and creative development. For the IT Showcase, I've worked on a project that uses artificial intelligence and computer vision to help assess animal health. It aims to support farmers, pet owners, and veterinarians.
My experience includes web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m expanding my skills by participating in the Black Data Processing Associates (BDPA) programs, researching, and refining my skills through practice. I enjoy applying STEM knowledge to real-world challenges and always strive to build tools that are meaningful, practical, and aligned with my values.
