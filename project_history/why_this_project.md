# üêæ Why This Project

I live on a farm and help care for several animals, including a pig, dogs, and chickens alongside my dad. Over time, I began to notice how challenging it can be to visually detect early signs of illness or discomfort in animals. This experience made me realize that many animal caretakers, especially those without veterinary training, face similar difficulties.

That observation became the spark for my IT Showcase project idea: to explore how artificial intelligence and computer vision could be used to support animal health assessment. I believed that if AI could help detect changes in animal behavior, posture, or appearance, it could serve as a powerful support tool for farmers, pet owners, and even veterinarians.

Initially, I considered more general ideas like showcasing web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Later, I explored the idea of creating Bible-based games, but both of those directions felt too common or outside the core theme. Eventually, I stumbled upon the concept of PetScope a vision-driven health monitoring tool for animals which aligned closely with both my personal experiences and the goals of the IT Showcase. This is the idea that my team approved, and it became the foundation of this research project.
