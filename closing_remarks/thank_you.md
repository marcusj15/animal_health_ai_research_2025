# Thank You + Advice

## Thank You

I want to thank everyone who supported me through this journey.  
- My family, for their patience and encouragement.
- My teacher/mentor, for their guidance and honest feedback.
- My friends and peers, who listened to my ideas and gave me motivation to keep going.

Your support made this project possible.

## Advice for Future Students

For anyone working on a similar project, here’s what I learned that might help you:

- **Start early** — You’ll thank yourself later when you have time to refine your work instead of rushing at the end.
- **Stay organized** — Keep your drafts, notes, and versions clearly labeled and backed up (like on Google Drive or GitHub).
- **Be flexible** — Your idea will change and that’s okay. Don’t be afraid to scrap parts and try again.
- **Ask for feedback** — Others will see things you missed. Take constructive criticism seriously.
- **Believe in yourself** — You don’t have to have everything figured out at the start. The process itself teaches you.

Thank you for taking the time to read and support my work.
