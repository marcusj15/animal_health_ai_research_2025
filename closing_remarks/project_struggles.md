# Project Struggles

While developing this research project and preparing it for the IT Showcase, I faced several challenges that tested my patience, creativity, and discipline.

- **Idea refinement**: My initial concept was very broad. Narrowing it down into something clear, realistic, and impactful was not easy. I had to think deeply about what problem I was solving and who my users would actually be.
  
- **Organization**: Keeping track of drafts, notes, and feedback became messy at times. Between outlines, scrapped sections, and multiple versions of the paper, I learned how important it is to organize files properly and label everything clearly.

- **Time management**: Balancing this project with school, meetings, and other responsibilities required me to set priorities and stick to deadlines. Procrastination definitely made things harder at times.

- **Overthinking**: At certain points, I doubted my idea and felt tempted to start over. Learning to trust the process and move forward even when things didn’t feel perfect was an important lesson.

- **Technical limits**: Some of my ideas for the app’s features and design were a bit too ambitious for the current timeline and resources. Learning to scale down without losing value was challenging but necessary.

Despite these struggles, each step helped me grow as a student, researcher, and developer.
