# Outline

## Problem Explanation

### Significance of the Issues
These common challenges in animal care lead to delayed treatment, animal suffering, unnecessary costs, and stress for owners, caretakers, and rescue workers. Addressing them is critical to improving animal health outcomes.

### How Will Technology Fix These Problems?
PetScope combines **Computer Vision (CV)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to deliver real-time diagnostics, education, and tracking tools for animals. CV analyzes images and videos, while AI learns patterns and makes predictions. Together, they help owners and professionals make informed decisions.

## Issues to Cover

### 1. No Quick Diagnosis Tool for Pet Owners & Professional Animal Caretakers

#### The Issue
Most pet owners lack the training or tools to assess animal health at home. Subtle signs are often ignored or misinterpreted, leading to unnecessary panic or dangerous delays.

#### Why It’s a Problem
- Health issues go unnoticed until severe.
- Caretakers are left guessing, causing stress and wrong decisions.
- In rural areas with limited vet access, this is life-threatening.

#### How the App Fixes It
- Real-time symptom scanner using CV.
- AI provides instant health risk analysis and next steps.

### 2. Inability to Identify Conditions of Stray or Wild Animals for Rescue Organizations

#### The Issue
Rescue teams and shelters can’t assess animal health in the field, forcing them to capture and transport animals blindly.

#### Why It’s a Problem
- Visual assessments are unreliable.
- Transporting sick or aggressive animals is dangerous and stressful.
- No early detection of diseases in wild populations, risking outbreaks.

#### How the App Fixes It
- Field-ready app identifies injuries, stress, or illness on the spot.
- Reduces unnecessary transports and improves decision-making during rescues.

### 3. Guesswork in Knowing Animal Breeds

#### The Issue
Owners and breeders often don’t know the exact breed of their animals, especially mixed-breed or unverified purchases.

#### Why It’s a Problem
- Wrong diets or missed genetic disease risks.
- Incorrect behavioral expectations or training.

#### How the App Fixes It
- CV-powered breed identifier for accurate recognition.

---

### 4. Vet Visits Without Preparation

#### The Issue
Most owners visit the vet without prior tracking of their pet’s health patterns or history, limiting the vet’s ability to diagnose effectively.

#### Why It’s a Problem
- Vets waste time gathering basic data.
- Owners misreport or forget symptoms.
- Emergency visits are inefficient without historical records.

#### How the App Fixes It
- Health log tracker synced to the pet’s profile, capturing data over time.
- Vets access this information directly during visits.

## App Additions

### Lack of Digital Animal Health Passports for Zoos or Shelters
#### The Issue
No universal system exists to track and share animal health records.

#### How the App Fixes It
- Creates a **Digital Animal Health Passport** with vet history, vaccinations, diet, and behavior logs for easy sharing between facilities.

---

### No “Fitness Coach” App for Pets
#### The Issue
Pets and working animals have different fitness needs, but no tool guides their exercise.

#### How the App Fixes It
- Fitness tracker suggests exercise routines based on breed, age, and goals.
- Syncs with collars or smart tags for feedback.

---

### Lack of Kid-Friendly Animal Education Tools
#### The Issue
Animal care apps are too technical for children.

#### How the App Fixes It
- Kid-friendly mode with gamified learning, animations, and interactive lessons on animal care.

---

### No Pet Health Integration with Smart Devices
#### The Issue
Smart devices don’t link animal activity to health data.

#### How the App Fixes It
- Integrates with smart collars, feeding stations, and cameras, syncing with the pet’s health log.

---

### Detects Symptoms of Pets Prior to Going to the Vet
#### The Issue
Symptoms often go unnoticed until serious.

#### How the App Fixes It
- AI & CV analyze posture, mood, sounds, and movement to flag symptoms early.

---

## Problem & Solution

### What Technological Tools Will the App Use?
- **Computer Vision (CV):**
  - Image classification.
  - Object detection.
  - Pattern detection.
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
  - Predictive modeling.
  - Behavioral analysis.

### How CV and AI Work Together
CV collects visual/audio data and classifies it. AI analyzes patterns, learns over time, and predicts outcomes. Together they provide accurate, real-time diagnostics—something neither can achieve alone.

## Important Determinations

### What is AI?
AI is software that learns patterns from data and makes predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

### What is CV?
Computer Vision is technology that enables machines to interpret and analyze visual data like photos or videos.

### How AI Works
AI learns from datasets, detects correlations, and refines predictions through feedback.

### How CV Works
CV analyzes visual input, detects objects, patterns, and abnormalities, and translates them into data.

### Specific AI/CV Tasks in PetScope
- CV identifies visible symptoms, injuries, breed, and behavior.
- AI assesses risk levels, predicts health issues, and suggests next steps.
